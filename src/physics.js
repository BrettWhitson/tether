/**
 * Tether's physics: a force simulation behind every layout, Four forces,
 * one setting each, all acting in every direction:
 *
 *  - center:   pulls nodes toward the graph's own middle (keeps it compact without moving it)
 *  - repel:    pushes nodes away from each other (Barnes-Hut, O(n log n))
 *  - link:     how strongly links pull their ends toward the link distance (0 = links don't pull at all)
 *  - distance: the length links settle at
 *
 * Plus a structure force for the layout, and collision so nodes (and their labels) don't overlap:
 *  - "layered": each node is pulled toward the line for its level, `distance` apart along the flow axis;
 *  - "radial":  the result is pinned in the centre; each node is pulled toward the ring for its depth.
 * Center also sets how firmly nodes hold their level or ring (0 loose, 1 crisp).
 *
 * The simulation keeps running while a node is dragged: the dragged node is held under the pointer and everything
 * else reacts (neighbours follow, others make room), then it cools down and settles.
 * Deterministic: the same input gives the same layout (no random starts; ties are broken by index).
 * Works on plain arrays (see layout-graph.js) and allocates nothing per tick beyond its first.
